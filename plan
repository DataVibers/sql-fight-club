OH THIS IS MAGNIFICENT. Okay, here's how to split this chaos three ways:
##Person 1: The Database Ringmaster 🦆
Files: app/db/, app/models/, app/utils/sql_safety.py
Your mission:

Set up DuckDB with hilariously random data (tables like unicorn_sightings, pizza_toppings_by_mood, failed_startups)
Build the SQL safety validator (block DROP/DELETE, add timeouts)
Create the data models for fight logs
Vibe: You're building the arena. Make the data absurd enough that agents have fun stuff to query

Key deliverables:

duckdb_init.py - creates connection, seeds tables
sql_safety.py - validates queries are SELECT-only
fight_log.py - Pydantic models for rounds/results


##Person 2: The AI Whisperer 🧠
Files: app/agents/, app/core/scoring.py
Your mission:

Build the agent system that generates SQL queries via LLM
Write prompts that make agents increasingly unhinged ("Your opponent just used 3 CTEs. Embarrass them.")
Create the complexity/fun scoring system (points for window functions, recursive CTEs, chaos)
Vibe: You're the agent's voice. Make them trash-talk in SQL comments

Key deliverables:

base_agent.py - SQLAgent interface
openai_agent.py - LLM integration (Claude API works too if you want!)
scoring.py - calculates how absurd each query is


##Person 3: The Showrunner 🎭
Files: app/core/fight_manager.py, app/ui/streamlit_app.py, app/config.py
Your mission:

Build the fight orchestrator (manages rounds, executes queries, handles errors)
Create the Streamlit UI with live updates
Add dramatic flair (animated emojis when queries fail, victory screens)
Vibe: WWE announcer energy. This UI should make people lose their minds

Key deliverables:

fight_manager.py - runs the fight loop, coordinates agents & DB
streamlit_app.py - the visual spectacle
config.py - settings like rounds, timeouts, API keys


##Git Strategy for This
Branch names:
bashgit checkout -b db-arena        # Person 1
git checkout -b ai-agents       # Person 2  
git checkout -b fight-ui        # Person 3
Integration points to sync on:

Person 1 → Person 2: Share the DB schema early so agents know what tables exist
Person 2 → Person 3: Define the agent interface so fight_manager knows how to call agents
Person 1 + 3: Agree on the fight_log data structure

##Meet-up moments:

After 1 hour: Quick sync to make sure interfaces match
After 3 hours: Integration party - wire everything together
Final hour: Add memes, test with hilarious data, practice your demo


##Pro Tips for This Specific Project

Person 1: Seed at least 3-4 weird tables with different data types. Think: timestamps, JSONs, arrays - give the agents ammo
Person 2: Test your prompts early! The agents should escalate from simple SELECTs to absolute mayhem by round 5
Person 3: Streamlit has st.empty() for live updates - use it to make queries appear in real-time like a chat feed

##The Demo Script
When you present, have Person 3 drive:

Click "Start Fight"
Watch Agent A write a basic query
Agent B responds with window functions
By round 4 they're doing recursive CTEs about fictional unicorn genealogy
Round 5: someone's query times out and Streamlit displays "💀 FATALITY"

The room will lose it.
Now go forth and make SQL agents roast each other. First rule of SQL Fight Club: we DO talk about SQL Fight Club.
